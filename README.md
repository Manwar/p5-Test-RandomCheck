# NAME

Test::BangAway - Yet another QuickCheck for Perl

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::BangAway;
    use Test::BangAway::Generator;
    use Test::More;

    sub my_length { ... }

    # Define types of values which is used while testing.
    my $type_of_arguments = concat(string, string);

    bang_away_ok {
        my ($s1, $s2) = @_;
        # Write a property which the my_length has.
        my_length($s1) + my_length($s2) == my_length($s1 . $s2);
    } $type_of_arguments;

    done_testing;

# DESCRIPTION

Test::BangAway is an implementation of QuickCheck in Perl.

You may want to define any kind of test arguments by using conbinators
prepared by [Test::BangAway::Generator](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::BangAway::Generator).

# FUNCTIONS

- `<bang_away_ok { ... } $generator;`\>

    Run blocks with arguments generated by $generator. $generator must have
    pick() method which returns arguments randomly for the block.

    It outputs "OK" if the block returns the true value for all random petterns.

# SEE ALSO

[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) is a test library for Haskell
to define properties of functions and to run tests randomly.

[Test::LectroTest](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::LectroTest) is another implementation of QuickTest which uses
the source code filter and has haskell like syntax (CamelCase class names).
